coincidentally matches that of a bird. Despite being bound to a wheelchair due to his
disabilities since childhood, Robin has always harbored a deep fascination for the stars in the night sky. He longs to live up to his name and soar high like his avian namesake. 

However, Robin is frustrated by the limitations of his physical condition, which prevent him from experiencing the world from a higher perspective. Determined to overcome his fate, he sets his sights on climbing the tallest mountain in the world, Aurora’s Peak, hoping to fulfill his childhood dream of reaching the stars.

Undeterred by the mountain's treacherous terrain, Robin draws upon his expertise as a
professional engineer to invent a series of unconventional gadgets to aid him in his ascent. Armed only with his tools and his unbreakable will, Robin sets out to conquer the mountain and finally witness the beauty of the stars from above.
